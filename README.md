# An Earthquake Query System Based on Hidden Markov Models

Seismic waves are signals that may be generated by earthquakes. These waves are happening after a strong release of energy. Seismic waves may cause vibrations on the surface of the earth detected and recorded by a seismograph. We cannot directly predict where a high magnitude vibration will happen from recorded observations but with a hidden Markov model, we can predict an earthquake with a high magnitude, HMM will be implemented from earthquake historical data. An earthquake query system (EQS) is implemented to check the probability of a specific state sequence. The proposed system can predict professionally if the next state will be an earthquake with a 'strong' magnitude or not. Results showed that EQS can be used by governments for early warning and evacuations.
